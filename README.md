Text Spectacles Project


The Text Spectacles project is a Java-based web application designed to analyze the frequency of words in a given text message. The application utilizes Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) to encapsulate the business logic and provide a scalable, robust solution

Functionality

1. Text Analysis: The application accepts a text message as input and calculates the frequency of each word in the message.
2. Error Handling: Custom exceptions are used to handle invalid input scenarios, such as empty messages or messages containing digits.
3. EJB-based Architecture: The business logic is encapsulated within EJBs, providing a scalable, robust solution.

Usage

To use the Text Spectacles application, follow these steps:

1. Generate EJB Beans: Create EJB beans for the TextSpectaclesEJB class, which encapsulates the business logic.
2. Deploy the Application: Deploy the web application to a Java EE-compliant server.
3. Access the Application: Access the application through a web browser, providing a text message as input.

Note: This project assumes a basic understanding of Java EE, EJBs, and web application development.
